# Lab 1 ECOMMERCE
 ## a.Objective: 
 
        1.To install Python, its framework, and database tools. 
        2.To develop a project using the Django framework.  
        3.To verify the frontend and backend in the browser. 
        4.To add other users and perform CRUD operations.
        5.To create product module named Brands.

  ## b. Introduction:
  
  E-commerce refers to a business that conducts its operations over the Internet. Python is a programming language that may be used to create websites and applications, automate processes, and analyze data. Python is a programming language with many uses. To summarize, Python may be used to create a wide range of applications and is not limited to a single problem. Django is a Python web framework that allows for quick development with a simple, functional design. SQLite is a C language package that implements a full-featured SQL database engine that is tiny, quick, self-contained, and dependable. GitHub is a code hosting and collaboration platform.

  ## c. Procedure:

**1. Initializing environment**

  We downloaded the software and environments required for the project. Those were:
  * Python
  * Pip
  * Sqlite
  * DBeaver
  * Django
  * VS Code
  * Github account

**2. we initialize django project and migrated files**

    syntax:
      python - m django startproject ecommerce_babin
      cd ecommerce_babin
      
      
 **3. initialize the database** 
 
     To run the project: 
     syntax:              
        python manage.py runserver
              To add a module: python manage.py startapp product_module
              
  **4. Source Control**
Finally, for source control, we used Git. We built a repository called ecommerce babinÂ and a markdown file called "lab1.md" that contains this document. The code and folder were then committed and published to the repository. The repository is now available at:https://github.com/BabeenDangol/Ecommerce_BabinDangol/

  ## e. Conclusion:
  
  As a result, in the first lab, we built our own project using the Django framework. There is now a superuser. I started the server, verified that the database was up and running, and then tested both the frontend and backend. On the server, I performed a CRUD activity and installed the branding module.
